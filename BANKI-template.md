## Technical Questions

Most of the technical questions should have a three sentence response in the EUE format:

- **Explanation**
- **Use**
- **Example**

### HTML

- [x] What does a doctype do?
  - **Explanation:** A doctype (short for document type declaration) is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. It is generally the first line that appears in your HTML documents. It helps the browser understand how to render the page. It doesn't add anything visible to the page itself, but without it, browsers may go into "quirks mode" and render the page inconsistently.
  - **Use:** Doctype is used at the beginning of your HTML document to signal to the web browser the version of HTML you're using. It's important to always include the doctype to ensure your pages render consistently across different browsers.
  - **Example:** A simple example of a doctype declaration is `<!DOCTYPE html>`, which is used for HTML5.
  - **Source:** [MDN Web Docs: Doctype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype)
- [x] How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?
  - **Explanation:** There are several ways to serve a page with content in multiple languages. The main methods include using the HTML `lang` attribute to specify language for the whole page or for individual elements, using server-side or client-side language detection to serve different versions of pages, or using Content Management Systems (CMS) that support multi-language content.
  - **Use:** Serving multi-language content is crucial for websites that target users from different countries or speakers of different languages. This can greatly enhance user experience and accessibility.
  - **Example:** Here's an example of using the `lang` attribute in HTML: `<html lang="en">` for English, `<html lang="es">` for Spanish. For server-side language detection, you might use HTTP Accept-Language headers, IP address geolocation or user preferences stored in a profile or a cookie. For example, in PHP you might use `$_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE']` to get the user's language.
  - **Source:** [MDN Web Docs: Language tags in HTML and XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang)
- [x] What kinds of things must you be wary of when designing or developing for multilingual sites?
  - **Explanation:** There are a few considerations when designing or developing for multilingual sites. These include text expansion (text length can vary between languages), direction of text (some languages are read right-to-left), character encoding (UTF-8 is recommended), localisation (adapting your site to local cultures and norms), and date/time and number formats.
  - **Use:** These considerations help to ensure that your website is not only translated correctly, but also culturally appropriate and user-friendly for all users regardless of their language or location.
  - **Example:** If your site uses buttons with text, the button size may need to be flexible to account for text expansion in different languages. Similarly, a date displayed as "MM/DD/YYYY" would be confusing for users in a country where "DD/MM/YYYY" is the norm.

- [x] What are `data-` attributes good for?
  - **Explanation:** `data-` attributes in HTML allow you to store extra information or custom data on any HTML element. The stored data can then be used in JavaScript to create more interactive experiences.
  - **Use:** These attributes are used when there is no existing attribute for the purpose you need, or for private data for which there are no associated semantics. They can be used to store data that will be manipulated by JavaScript or CSS.
  - **Example:** `<div data-user="1234" data-date="2023-05-28">Some content</div>`
  - **Source:** [MDN Web Docs: Using data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes)

- [x] Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?
  - **Explanation:** The building blocks of HTML5 as an open web platform include: Semantic HTML tags, CSS3, SVG, WebGL, Geolocation, Web Storage, IndexedDB, File API, Web Workers, Web Sockets, Media (Audio & Video), Canvas, Forms, and more.
  - **Use:** These building blocks are used to develop web applications with more functionality, improved semantics, enhanced interactivity, and better accessibility.
  - **Example:** An example of a semantic HTML5 element is `<article>`, which represents a standalone piece of content in a document. CSS3 is used for styling, while the Canvas API can be used to draw 2D shapes and images for games or other visual displays.
  - **Source:** [MDN Web Docs: HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)

- [x] Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.
  - **Explanation:** All three are web storage technologies but they differ in lifespan and scope. Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent from a website and stored in a user's web browser, but they are included with every HTTP request, have size limits, and can expire. sessionStorage is limited to the duration of the page session and is cleared when the tab is closed. localStorage has a larger storage limit and data persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.
  - **Use:** Cookies are often used for session management, personalization, and tracking. sessionStorage is used to store data for the duration of a page session. localStorage is used for long-term local storage of data that can persist across browser sessions.
  - **Example:** A cookie might be used to remember a user's login status. sessionStorage might be used to remember the state of a JavaScript web application within a single tab. localStorage could be used to save user preferences that need to persist across many sessions.
  - **Source:** [MDN Web Docs: Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)

- [x] Describe the difference between `<script>, <script async> and <script defer>`.
  - **Explanation:** These tags control how JavaScript is loaded and run. `<script>` blocks HTML parsing until the script is loaded and run. `<script async>` does not block HTML parsing and executes as soon as the script is available. `<script defer>` does not block HTML parsing and guarantees the execution of scripts in the order they were declared, but only after the document has been parsed.
  - **Use:** Use `<script>` if your script needs to run before the page renders (though this is rarely needed). Use `<script async>` when your script is independent of any other scripts on the page and can run as soon as it's available. Use `<script defer>` if your script relies on the entire DOM being loaded and if it should run before the `DOMContentLoaded` event.
  - **Example:** `<script src="script.js"></script>`, `<script async src="script.js"></script>`, `<script defer src="script.js"></script>`
  - **Source:** [MDN Web Docs: script](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script)

Here is a helpful list of other reverse interview questions: [https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview](https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview)

## Whiteboard

When talking through a whiteboard problem or a coding challenge with an interviewer you should use the PREP method. (Don't write PREP in the actual interview, but use it now while doing codewars/leetcode). Going through this will help you engage with the interviewer (and possibly burn up some time ð)

- **Parameters**
  - Inputs
  - Ask questions
    - Will it always be a number?
    - Will it ever be negative?
    - Any gotchas?
- **Returns**
  - Ask questions
    - Do you want it returned or is a console.log better?
    - Should I pass a whole array of solutions back or just a single solution?
- **Examples**
  - Show a couple black box examples, aka test cases
    - I pass in these arguments and get these results, is that correct?
  - Examples are a good idea because "you have the receipts" if the interviewer decides to change things.
- **Pseudocode**
  - Write pseudocode of each of the steps
